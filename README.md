# GWAS SVatalog    
    
[GWAS SVatalog](https://svatalog.research.sickkids.ca/) is a web-based browsing and visualization tool to aid fine-mapping of GWAS loci with structural variations. It is part of the [LocusFocus](https://locusfocus.research.sickkids.ca/) suite of software tools (Panjwani et al. 2020) specializing in data integration of GWAS follow-up. GWAS SVatalog allows users to visualize linkage disequilibrium between our structural variant database and GWAS-associated loci found in GWAS Catalog (Sollis et al. 2023).    

The [GWAS SVatalog documentation](https://gwas-svatalog-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides details on how to use the tool.    
    
*The app is currently being updated to fix the computational time in creating the interactive plot.
